# Wasserstein-GAN-with-Discriminator-Optimal-Transport-WGAN-DOT-
This project explores the application of Discriminator Optimal Transport (DOT) to Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to improve training stability and the quality of generated samples. Based on experiments conducted on the MNIST dataset, the work combines the advantages of WGANs with optimal transport principles in the latent space.
